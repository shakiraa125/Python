# Students perfomence index prediction and visualization
[Data_Visualization Projects on USA House price dataset](https://github.com/shakiraa125/Data_Analytics/blob/main/project%20(1).ipynb)\
Developed an interactive data visualization project to analyze the USA House Price dataset, focusing on identifying trends and patterns in housing prices. Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create various visualizations, including bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps. The visualizations highlighted key insights such as the impact of location, property size, and amenities on house prices

[Mechine Learning project-Student perfomance index prediction](https://github.com/shakiraa125/Data_Analytics/blob/main/ML%20project1.ipynb)
Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict student performance indices based on various factors such as study time, attendance, family background, and previous grades. Conducted exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to identify key predictors of student success. Utilized regression and classification algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to build and compare models.

[Grocery Data Analysis Using Python PySpark](https://github.com/shakiraa125/Python/tree/main/PySpark/Grocery%20Data%20Analysis)
This project analyzes grocery sales data using PySpark to perform data transformations and generate insights. The dataset contains details about grocery items, sales amounts, and outlets. The goal is to use PySpark's powerful distributed computing capabilities to process the data efficiently and perform meaningful operations such as aggregation and summarization.
